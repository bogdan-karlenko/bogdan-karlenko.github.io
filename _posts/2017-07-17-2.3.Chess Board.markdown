> Chess board
> ====
> Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8?8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a �#� character. The characters should form a chess board.
> 
> Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
> 
> 
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`` # # # #``  
> ``# # # # ``  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`` # # # #``  
> ``# # # # ``  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`` # # # #``  
> ``# # # # ``  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`` # # # #``  
> ``# # # # ``  
> 
> 
> When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

My solution:
====
{% highlight javascript %}
var size = 8;
for (i=0; i<size/2; i++) {
    var line = "";
          for (j=0; j<size/2; j++)
            if (i%2 == 0) 
              line += " #";
              else line += "# ";          
  console.log(line);
}
{% endhighlight %}
